  I am a certified sommelier with a strong passion for wine, hospitality, and
  storytelling through taste. With years of experience in wine pairing, cellar
  management, and guest education, I specialize in creating memorable dining
  experiences that celebrate the harmony between wine and cuisine. I
  continuously explore new regions, producers, and styles to deepen my knowledge
  and bring fresh perspectives to the table.
