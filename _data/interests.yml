- As a sommelier, I’m passionate about the stories behind every bottle — from the hands that harvest the grapes to the regions that give each wine its unique identity. I take great interest in exploring lesser-known appellations and staying updated on emerging trends in sustainable viticulture and natural wines.
- I also enjoy curating memorable tasting experiences for guests, where wine becomes a bridge between culture, cuisine, and conversation. Pairing wines thoughtfully and introducing people to new flavors is one of the most rewarding aspects of my work.
